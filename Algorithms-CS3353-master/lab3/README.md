In this lab I explored how to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which aims to find the shortest path between any given number of nodes, using both brute force and dynamic programming (DP) approaches. I compared the time complexities of both algorithms on data sets of different sizes. Please see my lab report for a detailed comparison of the two implementations and an explanation of how I used the Strategy design pattern to structure my project.
