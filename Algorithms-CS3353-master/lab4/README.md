In this lab, I created heuristic (Tabu Search) and metaheuristic (Genetic Algorithm) searching algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Probelm. I compared the time complexity and performance of these algorithms to lab 3's brute force and dynamic programming approaches to the same problem. Please see my lab report for a detailed comparison of the algorithms and an explanation of how my Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm work, as well as a comparison of different Genetic Algorithm techniques implemented (including different mutation and crossover techniques).
