In this lab, I created recursive and iterative implementations of a Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search as well as A* and Djikstra searching algorithms. I wrote both adjacency list and adjacency matrix implementations of the data set. Finally, I compared the speeds of the different sorting algorithms on multiple data set sizes. Please see my lab report for further details.
